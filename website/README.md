This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the
server.

### Build

```

This command generates static content into the `build/` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

This website is built and deployed automatically to GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/deploy-website.yml`.
